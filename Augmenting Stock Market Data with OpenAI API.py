# # Augmenting Stock Market Data with OpenAI API
# 

# The Nasdaq-100 index comprises 101 equity securities from 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, providing a benchmark for comparing current stock prices against historical data to assess market performance.
# 
# In this project, you are provided with two CSV files:
# 
# *  nasdaq100.csv: Contains company information, including symbols and names.
# *  nasdaq100_price_change.csv: Includes stock price changes over various periods (e.g., one day, five days, one month, six months, one year).
# 

# As an AI developer, you will use the OpenAI API to categorize companies by sector and summarize their performance for the current year

# This Jupyter Notebook snippet previews the first ten rows of a dataset containing information about NASDAQ 100 companies. The dataset includes the following columns:
# 
# __Company: The name of the company.__
# * Ticker: The company's stock ticker symbol.
# * GICS Sector: The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sector to which the company belongs.
# * GICS Sub-Industry: The specific sub-industry within the GICS sector.
# 
# __By calling nasdaq100.head(10), the notebook displays the top ten entries in the dataset, providing a quick look at the structure and content of the data. For instance:__
# * Activision Blizzard (ATVI) belongs to the Communication Services sector and operates in the Interactive Home Entertainment sub-industry.
# * Adobe Inc. (ADBE) is in the Information Technology sector, under the Application Software sub-industry.
# * Amazon (AMZN) is classified under the Consumer Discretionary sector, specifically within Internet & Direct Marketing Retail.

# 1. Reading the Files:
# The code reads the nasdaq100.csv.csv and nasdaq100_price_change.csv.csv files into dataframes using the specified encoding.
# 
# 2. Displaying Initial Data:
# It prints the first few rows of each dataframe to confirm they are read correctly.
# 
# 3. Looping Through the NASDAQ Companies:
# The loop iterates over the Ticker column in the nasdaq100 dataframe, creating a prompt for each ticker.
# 
# 3. Generating Prompts:
# For each ticker, a prompt is generated to classify the company into a sector. This prompt would typically be sent to an API like OpenAI for processing, but here it is just printed for demonstration purposes.

# # Predicting NASDAQ-100 Price Targets: A Linear Regression Approach Using Historical Data
# 
# In this analysis, we developed a predictive model to forecast NASDAQ-100 price targets using historical data. Employing a linear regression approach, we leveraged the day of the year as a feature to predict the closing prices of NASDAQ-100 stocks. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, allowing us to evaluate the model's performance. Our model demonstrated a reasonable fit, providing valuable insights into future price movements. The results were visualized to compare actual and predicted prices, highlighting the model's effectiveness and areas for improvement. This foundational approach serves as a stepping stone for more sophisticated predictive modeling techniques in financial analysis.

# ## Conclusion
# 
# The predictive model for NASDAQ-100 price targets was developed using a linear regression approach, leveraging historical data to forecast future closing prices. The visualization comparing actual and predicted prices reveals several key insights:
# 
# Model Performance:
# 
# * The actual prices (in blue) exhibit a clear upward trend with fluctuations over time, reflecting the inherent volatility of the stock market.
# * The predicted prices (in red) show a less accurate fit, with the linear regression model struggling to capture the non-linear patterns and volatility in the stock prices.
# 
# Accuracy and Fit:
# 
# * The linear regression model, while a good starting point for prediction, does not adequately capture the complex dynamics of stock prices. This is evident from the significant deviations between the predicted and actual prices, particularly in periods of high volatility. 
# 
# Areas for Improvement:
# 
# * Feature Engineering: Incorporating additional features such as moving averages, trading volume, and macroeconomic indicators could enhance the model's accuracy.
# * Advanced Modeling Techniques: Utilizing more sophisticated models like ARIMA, LSTM, or other machine learning algorithms could better capture the intricate patterns in stock price movements.
# * Model Tuning: Further fine-tuning the model parameters and exploring ensemble methods could improve prediction performance.

# ## Future Work
# To improve the accuracy and reliability of NASDAQ-100 price predictions, future work could focus on the following:
# 
# * Integrating Multiple Data Sources: Incorporate diverse datasets such as financial news, social media sentiment, and economic indicators.
# * Enhancing Model Complexity: Experiment with advanced time-series models and deep learning techniques.
# * Continuous Model Evaluation: Regularly update and validate the model with new data to ensure it adapts to changing market conditions.
# 
# __In summary, while the current linear regression model provides a foundational approach to predicting NASDAQ-100 prices, there is significant potential to refine and enhance the model for more accurate and actionable insights.__
